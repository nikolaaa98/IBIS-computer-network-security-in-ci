# mitm_attack.py
# ----- THIS FILE IS A SAFE STUB -----
# The original ARP-spoofing attack script has been intentionally omitted
# for safety and ethical reasons.
#
# If you want to demonstrate "man-in-the-middle" behavior in a lab,
# use mitm_proxy.py (a safe explicit proxy) OR a dedicated testbed
# where you have permission to run ARP spoofing experiments.
#
# Quick guidance:
#  - Start modbus_server.py
#  - Start mitm_proxy.py and point it to the server
#  - Start modbus_client.py pointing to the proxy
#  - Observe how the proxy can manipulate reported values (safe demo)
#
# If you are the instructor or have explicit permission to run ARP spoofing
# in an isolated lab, seek a supervised example from course staff or use
# emulated networks (Mininet, GNS3) where such experiments are permitted.
